## Growing a local e-commerce brand, step by step 

> This is no small task, but taking up this challenge has been a learning experience, and a success on all fronts.

### Research, research, research 
Get to know your business, and your audience. Pull data from every possible avenue. In this case, we used Google Analytics, and our first hand follower data from our Social Media Channels. Got the data? Time to do something with it!
SMART Goals, Brand guidelines and ideal customer personas are put in place. Essential building blocks for future growth.

### Add a little bit of personality 
We are armed with brand guidelines, we know our audience, we know our tone of voice. Let's bring some consistency across the board. All your content, everywhere, needs to follow the brand guidelines. There are variations, sure. But no matter where your audience is, they should be able to immediately recognise your business. So this is what we do, get templates set up, sort out email marketing, social media, flyers & promo items. The foundations are in place for growth.

### SMART Goals 
Assess where you were, then decide where you want to go. SMART goals; Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-Bound. Aim high, but not too high, keep track over a few months, revisit, how did we do? Having these guidelines in place has helped Shapeshifter Nutrition to grow year on year, with a record year ahead for 2025.

### Techincal bits  
We know what we want, we need to remove roadblocks, and allow our customers to get to us. The website was slow, so we worked hard to change hosts, improve speed and re-design, and remove plugins that were bloating the site. Product descriptions were optimised, displaying all the info a customer would ever want to know about any product. Paid marketing & SEO is handled by our Marketing Agency (here's to you <a href="https://makeitrane.com/">RANE Digital Marketing</a>). We know were we came from, we know where we want to go, we're now in a rhythm, and ready to grow!

#### Wrapping up  
- Developed comprehensive brand guidelines for consistency  
- Goals are set, with a clear path, and roadmap for success  
- The team is grown, and gaps are filled by marketing partners
