## Growing a local e-commerce brand, step by step 

> Laying ground work for business growth, that has led to a 40% increase in revenue year on year.

### Research, research, research 
I hit the ground running, getting to know the business, and the audience. Pulling data from every possible avenue. In this case, I used Google Analytics, and first hand follower data from Social Media Channels.
With this, I decided on SMART Goals. Brand guidelines and ideal customer personas are put in place. Essential building blocks for future growth.

### Add a little bit of personality 
Armed with brand guidelines, we know our audience, we know our tone of voice. It was time to bring some consistency across the board. All of the content, everywhere, needed to follow the brand guidelines. The audience should be able to immediately recognise the business. So this is what I did; get templates set up, sort out email marketing, social media, flyers & promo items. The foundations are in place for growth.

### SMART Goals 
To get a better sense of success, I kept tabs on SMART goals. These help to assess where the business was, and steer future direction. SMART goals; Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-Bound. Aim high, but not too high, keep track over a few months, revisit, how did it go? Having these guidelines in place has helped Shapeshifter Nutrition to grow year on year, with a record year projected for 2025.

### Consistency is key
With everything in place, and a foundation laid, the next step was consistency. I helped to hire a new content creator. Content is flowing on a weekly basis, follwer count is growing, engagement is improving. Email marketing is consistent, twice a week, with proper segmentation of the audience, adding value for the audiences specific health and fitness needs.

### Techincal bits  
I need to remove roadblocks, and allow Shapeshifters customers to get to them. The website was slow, so I worked to change hosts, improve speed and re-design, and remove plugins that were bloating the site. Product descriptions were optimised, displaying all the info a customer would ever want to know about any product. Paid marketing & SEO is handled by our Marketing Agency (here's to you <a href="https://makeitrane.com/">RANE Digital Marketing</a>). We know were we came from, we know where we want to go, we're now in a rhythm, and ready to grow!

#### What I did: 
- Developed comprehensive brand guidelines for consistency  
- Set SMART goals, with a clear path, and roadmap for success, and the ability to track results
- Grow the team to fit business needs and enhance consistency, gaps are filled by external marketing partners
