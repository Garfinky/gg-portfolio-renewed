## Assessing, re-designing and fixing a broken Wordpress website  

> Having a functional website is essential for any business. Ian's website wasn't maintained, and he was having issues with downtime.

### Laying out the options
Ian was using a wordpress site, alongside a separate e-commerce system for photographers; Sytist. A lot of the Wordpress elements had broken, the website wasn't maintained by the original admin. Moving from Wordpress sections of the website, to Sytist, was jarring. There were visual inconsistencies between the two systems. My thoughts, were to completely rebuild in Wordpress using a Photography Plugin, or completely rebuild in Sytist (Sytist already had page layout tools, though not as feature rich as modern Wordpress). Given that Ian was used to working with Sytist, the option he chose was to stick with Sytist. I removed Wordpress altogether, and rebuilt the site in Sytist.

### Mocking up in Figma
I took some time to create the website in Figma first, to give Ian an idea of how the website might look when complete. Talking him through the design decisions, adding in keywords to improve SEO, adding some social proof and clearly laying out categories to allow customers to navigate to where they need to be.

### Testing the limits of Sytist 
Once Ian was happy with the mock up, I moved to sort out technical errors with the website, and re-design inside Sytist. SMTP was an issue, Ian's customers weren't receiving their confirmation emails, this was fixed with a simple password reset within the SMTP settings. Moving on to building the site in Sytist, I used Sytist built in page builder. This allows Ian to add additional content as and when he needs to, rather than having to edit code. I used some CSS to get the design as close as possible to the Figma mockup, with some limitations due to the use of the page builder. Rethinking this, I would delve deeper into the PHP of Sytist, and introduce a CSS library like Tailwind to modernise the website further.

#### Summary
- Reviewed the existing website, and gave Ian options on how to get it in a better place 
- Created a mock up in figma to give Ian visual reference  
- Fixed technical issues, and set up the site so it can be easily maintained/added to by Ian 
- Here's the finished site: <a href="https://www.ianpedlowphotography.com/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
