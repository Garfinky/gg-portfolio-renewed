## A Full Day of Content Creation  

> A well-planned content shoot can define a brand’s social presence. This project brought Shapeshifter Nutrition’s vision to life through dynamic visuals, engaging photography, and strategic video production.

### Planning Every Detail  
Collaborating with our social media manager, I sourced athletes, scouted locations, and developed a comprehensive plan, ensuring a seamless shoot day.

### Creative Direction That Tells a Story  
I gathered inspiration, crafted a detailed shot list, and outlined video concepts to maximise content variety for both organic and paid media.

### Bringing It to Life Behind the Lens  
Using the Sony Alpha AIII, I captured high-quality images and video footage, refining each shot to enhance Shapeshifter Nutrition’s brand presence.

### Editing & Final Touches  
Editing in Photoshop and Premiere Pro, I polished the content to ensure optimal engagement, producing assets ready for deployment across digital platforms.

#### Wrapping up 
- Organised and executed a structured photoshoot plan  
- Captured high-quality visuals for multi-platform use  
- Edited final imagery and video for brand storytelling
