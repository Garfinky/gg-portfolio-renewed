## Restoring Family History, One Photo at a Time  

> Restoring old photographs requires a balance of technical skill and attention to detail. Using Photoshop, I revived precious family memories, bringing faded images back to life.

### Starting With the Best Scan Possible  
Every restoration started with a precise, high-resolution scan to ensure maximum detail retention.

### Repairing Time’s Wear & Tear  
Using Photoshop’s clone stamp and advanced retouching techniques, I meticulously removed cracks, scratches, and other imperfections.

### Bringing Out the True Colours  
Finalising colour correction, brightness, and contrast adjustments ensured the restored images were vibrant yet true to their original state.

#### Summary
- Digitally restored heavily damaged historical photos  
- Applied precise retouching techniques for seamless restoration  
- Ensured natural colour and contrast accuracy
