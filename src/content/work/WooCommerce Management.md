## Building a Faster, Smarter Wordpress Site  

> A slow and buggy website hurts both UX and business performance. My goal was to transform Shapeshifter Nutritionâ€™s e-commerce platform into a fast, efficient, and optimised space for customers.

### Breaking Down the Issues  
Starting with a performance audit, I identified key issues and formulated a structured approach to optimise the website step by step.

### Upgrading Hosting & Plugins  
Migrating to a better host and refining plugin use significantly improved site speed and functionality.

### Strengthening SEO & Content  
Collaborating with an SEO expert, I enhanced content and refined product descriptions to meet Google Merchant Center requirements, enabling better search visibility.

### Keeping the Site Running Smoothly  
Beyond the initial fixes, I now oversee daily website operations, handling product uploads, plugin updates, and SEO integrations in collaboration with external agencies.

#### Summary
- Optimised site speed, UX, and content strategy  
- Improved product listings for better search presence  
- Manage ongoing performance and SEO updates
