## Breathing New Life Into Chaos Crew  

> Refreshing the face of a brand isn’t just about design, it’s about capturing a personality. With Chaos Crew, I transformed inspiration into a tangible brand identity that resonates with its audience.

### Digging Into the Market  
Before jumping into design, I explored the competitive landscape, analysing the target market and gathering insights on what makes strong branding work in the sports nutrition industry.

### Defining the Brand’s Personality  
Armed with research, I shaped Chaos Crew’s unique voice and vibe, establishing brand guidelines that ensured consistency across all touchpoints.

### Crafting the New Look  
From concept sketches to final packaging, I applied design principles that not only reflected Chaos Crew’s personality but also stood out against competitors on the shelf.

### Seeing It Through to Production  
Working with key stakeholders, I refined the design, ensuring a smooth transition from concept to production while maintaining brand integrity.

#### Wrapping up  
- Developed comprehensive brand guidelines for consistency  
- Re-imagined packaging with a fresh, standout aesthetic  
- Ensured brand personality matched market expectations
