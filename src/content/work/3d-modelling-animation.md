  3D modelling gives clients a better perspective on the final finished product. Here's how I use Blender to create product mockups and animations.

## What's the purpose of 3D modelling?

> 3D is a powerful tool for product visualisation, content creation and animation.

### How I utilise Blender 3D for product mockups 
When it comes to product packaging, visualising the end result is essential. Whether that's physically printing and building a box, or sticking a label on a tub or container, or digitally creating a mockup. The experience of seeing something "finished" gives me, and clients, a better understanding of how the design will live in the real world. Doing this digitally, gives me breathing room to see how certain elements of the design may not work, and to alter the design as needed.

### Going a step further, 3D animation & content creation
3D product mockups are one piece of the puzzle, but why let it end there? I've used 3D animation in the past, before a products release, to create teaser content. We don't have the finished product in hand, but we can let our audience experience a tast of what the final product might be. Some examples of this are at the end of the blog.

### Doesn't that take ages? 
Yes, yes it does. If you are modelling and keyframing by yourself, it can take time. Luckily Blender has an amazing community, and there are plenty of free and paid sources for models, characters and scenes. In the Stim Head Astronaut animation, I was able to model the product, and the background scene, while using pre-made assets for the Astronaut (which I edited to match the brands colours) and a character animation rig from <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/#/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mixamo</a> to speed up the process of creating this piece of content.

### 3D modelling software is expensive
Blender is free, completely free. No payment needed, and it's incredibly powerful & versitile. You can even edit your videos in it, and composite special effects & make games (if you know how). It has a steep learning curve, but one that is worth picking up, purely because of the doors it opens for content creation, and product visualisation.

#### In Summary: 
- 3D modelling is an essential tool for product visualisation 
- Animation is time consuming, but worth it!
- 3D modelling is easily accessible
